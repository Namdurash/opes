# Gate: spec-form — is the specification admissible?
#
# This is the machine half of "admission only in falsifiable form". It checks
# FORM, never content: whether each acceptance criterion is *written* so that a
# failing test could be composed from it. Whether it is the right criterion is a
# human question and is gated separately.
#
# What these checks CANNOT catch, stated here because a gate that oversells
# itself is worse than no gate:
#
#   - Grammatically clean, semantically empty. `then: "returns a valid
#     response"` passes. The vagueness list is unbounded and always one word
#     behind.
#   - Falsifiable but testing the wrong thing. No text check ever reaches intent.
#   - A compound assertion hiding behind one verb: "returns a valid JWT".
#   - An AC that is already true. Only verify-red catches that — which is the
#     honest division of labour: spec-form checks an AC is written falsifiably,
#     verify-red checks it actually was.
#   - Incompleteness. Nothing mechanical ever catches a missing AC. That is
#     precisely why the human gate is at the input, and why the question put to
#     the human is "is anything missing", not "is this right".
#
# Structured meta fields are English by design: every proxy below is a word
# list, and per-language conjunction and verb tables would fail in ways nobody
# predicts. The narrative body is in whatever language the ticket is in.
#
# PROVENANCE. Every criterion declares `from`: either a verbatim fragment of
# ticket.md or the id of the assumption it rests on. The check is a literal
# substring lookup — no regex, no fuzzy match — and it is the one thing here
# that reaches past FORM into WHERE THE SCOPE CAME FROM. A criterion that can
# point at neither a sentence the human wrote nor a decision the spec recorded
# is scope nobody asked for, and until this field existed there was no place
# where that showed: spec-judge reads the ticket, but "does the ticket support
# this" is a judgement, and this is a lookup.
#
# The same idea one level down: an assumption declares `because` (what left the
# question open), `instead_of` (the road not taken) and `affects` (the criteria
# that rest on it). Those three are not decoration — they are what `aif explain`
# draws, and it can draw nothing the station did not write. An empty `affects`
# is NOT rejected: forcing a link would buy a plausible id instead of an honest
# gap. It is printed on the pass path, the way plan-form prints an unvalidated
# external surface.
