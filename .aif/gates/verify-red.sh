# Gate: verify-red — do the new tests fail, for the right reason, before any
# implementation exists?
#
# "The tests fail" is far too weak to be worth checking. A SyntaxError fails. A
# misspelled import fails. A test that was never collected did not fail — it is
# absent. Any of those, accepted as "red", launders confidence: it lets a broken
# oracle through and calls it a passing gate. So this gate checks the FAILURE
# MODE, not the failure:
#
#   - the pre-existing suite is green (a repo already broken makes "red"
#     meaningless) → exit 3 if not
#   - each new test is present in the report AND failing
#   - each failure is a legitimate class (assertion, missing module), not a
#     broken one (syntax, collection error) → exit 3 if broken
#   - every acceptance criterion is covered by a test, and its expected literal
#     appears in a test
#   - no implementation was written (the plan's create paths must not exist yet)
#
# On success it writes tests.lock, the frozen record of this boundary: the test
# hashes, the implementation hashes at red-time (for green's revert-recheck), and
# the coverage. That file, not the scattered test output, is what the implement
# station's precondition binds to.
