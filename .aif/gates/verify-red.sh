# Gate: verify-red — do the new tests fail, for the right reason, before any
# implementation exists?
#
# "The tests fail" is far too weak to be worth checking. A SyntaxError fails. A
# misspelled import fails. A test that was never collected did not fail — it is
# absent. Any of those, accepted as "red", launders confidence: it lets a broken
# oracle through and calls it a passing gate. So this gate checks the FAILURE
# MODE, not the failure:
#
#   - the pre-existing suite is green (a repo already broken makes "red"
#     meaningless) → exit 3 if not
#   - each new test is present in the report, and each failing one fails for a
#     legitimate class (assertion, missing module), not a broken one (syntax,
#     collection error) → exit 3 if broken
#   - every acceptance criterion is covered by a test, and its expected literal
#     appears in a test
#   - no implementation was written (the plan's create paths must not exist yet)
#
# A new test that PASSES at freeze is not rejected. On a second round — a
# reworked ticket whose earlier round already implemented some criteria — the
# honest test for a built criterion is green before this round's implementation
# exists, and demanding red there is jointly unsatisfiable with demanding
# coverage: include the file and N tests "pass already", exclude it and M
# criteria are "not referenced". The one workaround is an artificial
# precondition that breaks the built behaviour so the test can fail first —
# manufactured evidence, which is worse than a recorded gap. So a green test is
# recorded in tests.lock.json as green_at_freeze — "green at freeze, never
# proven red" — excluded from `covering` (green's revert-recheck must not
# target a test that never depended on this round's code), and re-surfaced on
# the closing checklist. If EVERY new test is green, that is still a rejection:
# nothing red remains, so either the ticket is already done or the tests assert
# nothing.
#
# On success it writes tests.lock.json, the frozen record of this boundary: the test
# hashes, the implementation hashes at red-time (for green's revert-recheck), the
# coverage, and the green-at-freeze list. That file, not the scattered test
# output, is what the implement station's precondition binds to.

#                     or a fixture that no plan lists. This net is correct and
#                     stays.
#   plan.files.tests — THIS ticket's own oracle. A project whose roots point at
#                     one tree while its tests live beside their sources cast the
#                     net over the wrong tree entirely: the ticket's tests were
#                     absent from the lock, so the freeze guarantee — the one
#                     that stops the implement station editing the oracle it is
#                     judged against — did not apply to them at all, and nothing
#                     noticed. The plan already declares these files and
#                     $test_files has been in scope since line 55.
#
# impl_frozen records the implementation as it is NOW (before code) so green can
# restore it and confirm the tests go red again; create paths do not exist yet,
# so they are recorded as to-be-created. covering is the new RED test ids, for
# green's revert-recheck to target; a test green at freeze goes to
# green_at_freeze instead — reverting this round's code was never going to turn
# it red, and demanding that would accuse an honest test on a second round.
