# PreToolUse guard. Denies a writer from writing where it must not:
#
#   - the implement station may not touch tests, the test station may not touch
#     implementation;
#   - the orchestrator may not write product code at all, because code written
#     outside a station is code no gate ever saw.
#
# Which station is running arrives by one of two routes, and both are live:
#
#   - agent_type in the hook payload, when the station runs as a SUBAGENT. This
#     is the real signal — Claude Code puts agent_type (and agent_id) in the
#     payload only for calls originating inside a subagent, and omits the keys
#     entirely for the main session. Measured, not assumed.
#   - AIF_STATION in the environment, a leftover from when a station ran as
#     `claude -p`. That path is gone; the fallback is kept only so an older
#     installed set keeps working, and goes when nothing can set it.
#
# The payload wins when both are present: it describes the call actually being
# made, whereas an inherited environment variable describes an ancestor.
#
# AIF_RUN, exported by `aif run`, says this session IS a foundry run. Without it
# the hook does nothing beyond the station rules — a project with aif installed
# is still an ordinary project, and a plain `claude` in it must not find its
# Write tool policed.
#
# This is a speed bump on the lazy path, not a security boundary. green's
# hash-lock is the real arbiter — it catches a defeated oracle after the fact.
# The hook stops the honest-but-lazy model from editing a test in the first
# place, and, crucially, names the legal move so it does not escalate to a
# workaround. A model told only "no" gets creative; a model told "no, do X
# instead" does X.
#
# Runs from the project during a claude session, so it uses only POSIX tools and
# whatever jq the project has. No aif on PATH.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The orchestrator: inside a run, and not a subagent.
#
# It may not write product code. This is the defect that started the rebuild:
# on OPES-48 the implement station exhausted its turn budget, and the session
# then finished the feature itself, in-session — outside green, outside scope,
# and with nothing in the ledger to say it had happened. The commit looked like
# any other.
#
# What it MAY write is tasks/, and that is not a loophole: everything there is
# gated against its current bytes by spec-form, plan-form and the judges, so a
# repair made with the user in front of the artifact is checked exactly as a
# station's output would be. Refusing it would only mean refusing the repair
# bench.
#
# Honest limits, since a guard that oversells itself is worse than none:
#   - this matches Write/Edit tools only. `bash -c 'echo … > src/f.py'` walks
#     straight past it. Matching Bash would mean parsing shell, which is
#     fragile enough to fail open in ways nobody notices.
#   - the real backstop for code is scope, which diffs against the last commit
#     and rejects any file the plan did not name, whoever wrote it. This hook
#     exists so the honest-but-helpful path is closed early and by name, not so
#     the determined one is impossible.
